# Single-photon-single-pixel-imaging
Contains the code and experimental data for the paper "Single photon single pixel imaging into thick scattering medium"

# Requirements
As the solver used a regularization by denoising approach, some Matlab toolboxes need be installed (added to the path)
before the main script:SPC_2D_Exp.m can run successfully.
1: BM3D toolbox
2: unlocbox (an optimzation toolset)
